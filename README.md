# Power BI Exploration of Inflation and Debt in OECD Countries

This interactive Power BI project delves into the financial landscapes of OECD member countries, offering insightful visualizations into two critical economic indicators: **inflation** rates and **debt-to-GDP** ratios. Navigate through curated dashboards and explore trends over time, identify correlations, and gain valuable insights into the economic climate of individual nations.


## Project Requirements

- Range 2-3 pages
- Using at least 5 different types of visuals
- Filtering with slicers
- Use of bookmarks/page navigation
- Connecting multiple data sources, whether in Power Query or Power BI
- Using a data hierarchy of at least two levels
- Creation of at least 1 measure and 1 calculated column
- Graphic editing of the used visuals and a visually friendly resulting report
## Steps Followed


1) Getting raw data from OECD official website
2) Fetching data in csv files into Power BI via Power Query
3) Power Query work - used filters, changed data types, removed columns
4) Creating Calendar Table using DAX code
5) Merging tables countries, regions and continents by LEFTOUTER JOIN
6) Creating relationships between tables (1:M and 1:1)
7) Creating Measures and Calculated columns using DAX codes
8) Adding Hiearchy for location classification
9) Creating 1st page while using layout with navigation arrows, slicers, bookmarks and mulitple different visuals
10) Duplicating 1st page to create remaining two pages while changing visuals and its data
11) Using conditional formating for matrix and map visuals
